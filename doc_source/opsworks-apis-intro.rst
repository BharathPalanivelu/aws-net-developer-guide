Programming |OPSlong| to Work with Stacks and Applications
##########################################################

The |sdk-net| supports |OPSlong|, which provides a simple and flexible way to create and manage
stacks and applications. With |OPS|, you can provision AWS resources, manage their configuration,
deploy applications to those resources, and monitor their health. For more information, see 
|OPS|_.

The SDK provides APIs for programming with |OPS|. These APIs typically consist of sets of
matching request-and-response objects that correspond to HTTP-based API calls focusing on their
corresponding service-level constructs.

For related API reference information, see :code:`Amazon.OpsWorks` and :code:`Amazon.OpsWorks.Model`
in the |sdk-net-ref|_.
