Managing Users With |IAMlong| (|IAM|)

   :description: .NET code examples for AWS IAM
   :keywords: AWS SDK for .NET examples, IAM

The |sdk-net| supports |IAM|, which is a web service that enables AWS
customers to manage users and user permissions in AWS.

The sample code is written in C#, but you can use the |sdk-net| with any compatible
language. When you install the |TVSlong| a set of C# project templates are installed. So the simplest way to start this
project is to open Visual Studio, and then choose :guilabel:`File`, :guilabel:`New Project`,
:guilabel:`AWS Sample Projects`, :guilabel:`Deployment and Management`,
:guilabel:`AWS Identity and Access Management User`.

For related API reference information, see :sdk-net-api:`Amazon.IdentityManagement <IAM/NIAM>` and
:sdk-net-api:`Amazon.IdentityManagement.Model <IAM/NIAMModel>`.

**Prerequisites**

Before you begin, be sure that you have created an AWS account and set up your AWS credentials. For
more information, see :ref:`net-dg-setup`.
